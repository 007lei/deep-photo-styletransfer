* [cudnn](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)

Download VGG-19:
```
sh models/download_models.sh
```

Compile ``cuda_utils.cu``
```
make clean && make
```

## Usage
To generate all results (in ``/examples`` folder) using the provided scripts, simply run 
```
run('gen_laplacian/gen_laplacian.m')
```
in Matlab and then
```
python gen_all.py
```
in Python. The final output will be in ``/examples/final_results`` folder.
